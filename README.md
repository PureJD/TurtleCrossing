# TurtleCrossing
#### This is a version of Frogger created in Python, using the turtle graphics library. The program utilises object-oriented programming in which classes are created and used but also hierarchy is used to inherit class attributes.

#### The game will load the player into the level in which cars have been generated using a cars class with randomised attributes. The car are then saved to a list and propelled across the screen at random intervals of speed.

#### If the user is unable to make it to the top of the screen he is flattened by the car and it is the end of the game.

#### The user is then able to control the turtle in all four directions in order to attempt to reach the top section of the level. Once that is achieved the game will generate further cars using the cars class and save them to the list for use. Due to the exponential multiplier, levels become difficult quickly.

#### Future considerations for this project include recreating the project utilising the Python pygame library which will allow higher performance. Also, the use of images or sprites for the cars and road would make the game seem more realistic.
